# Credly

Credly is a decision-intelligence platform for influencer marketing that helps brands and creators make credible, transparent collaboration decisions.

Instead of relying on vanity metrics like follower count and likes, Credly focuses on trust signals, explainable insights, and compatibility analysis so both sides understand why a collaboration makes sense before it happens.

---

## Problem Statement

Influencer marketing today is largely driven by shallow signals and opaque decisions.

Common issues include:
- Brands selecting creators based on popularity rather than fit
- Creators being rejected or ignored without any explanation
- Fake or misleading engagement signals
- No visibility into brand quality from a creator’s perspective
- No structured learning from past collaborations

This results in wasted time, poor partnerships, and loss of trust on both sides.

---

## Solution

Credly introduces an intelligence layer that sits before influencer collaborations.

The platform is designed to support decision-making, not transactions. It provides clarity, context, and reasoning so users can evaluate collaborations with confidence.

Key capabilities include:
- Influencer Trust Scores based on behavioral and contextual signals
- Explainable insights that show why a score or recommendation exists
- Brand–creator compatibility analysis
- Campaign fit evaluation for creators
- Historical collaboration feedback and pattern recognition
- Separate dashboards for brands and creators

All insights are presented in a neutral, human-readable manner.
